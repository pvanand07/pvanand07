👋 Hi, I’m Anand Siva

👀 I’m interested in data science and machine learning, and using these technologies to solve real-world problems and make a positive impact.

🌱 I’m currently learning about various machine learning algorithms and techniques, and I am always seeking to improve my skills and knowledge in this field. I am also interested in learning about new and emerging technologies and their potential applications.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that involve using data and machine learning to solve problems and make a difference. I am open to working with others who share similar interests and goals.

📫 You can reach me via my [Linkedin profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anandsivapv/). Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or if there is any way that I can help!
